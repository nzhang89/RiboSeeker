Description: Ribosome profiling is a technology for determining translation activity by 
sequencing ribosome protected mRNA fragments. We developed RiboSeeker, an end-to-end package 
for ribosome profiling data analysis. RiboSeeker consists of two main components: data 
processing and downstream analysis at single nucleotide resolution. The first component was 
written in Snakemake, a workflow management language, for scalable and reproducible data 
processing. Taking raw FASTQ reads, the workflow performs adapter sequence trimming, RNA 
contamination removal, and alignment to a reference genome. Next, starting from an alignment 
file, a variety of downstream analysis and visualization functionalities were implemented in 
R, such as read length distribution, genomic feature distribution of aligned reads, and 
metagene plots. Based on the metagene plots, users can define the desired read length and 
P-site offset, and further measure the translation of open reading frames (ORFs) by calculating 
translation efficiency and discover novel ORFs by computing ORFscore. Altogether, RiboSeeker 
covers the essential data processing and analysis steps for ribosome profiling experiments.
