Description: Ribosome profiling is a technology for determining translation activity by 
    sequencing ribosome protected mRNA fragments. We developed RiboSeeker, an end-to-end 
    package for ribosome profiling data analysis. RiboSeeker consists of two main components: 
    data processing and downstream analysis at single nucleotide resolution. The first 
    component was written in Snakemake, a workflow management language, for scalable and 
    reproducible data processing. Taking raw FASTQ reads, the workflow performs adapter 
    sequence trimming, RNA contamination removal, and alignment to a reference genome. Next, 
    starting from an alignment file, a variety of downstream analysis and visualization 
    functionalities were implemented in R, such as read length distribution, genomic feature 
    distribution of aligned reads, and metagene plots. Based on the metagene plots, users can 
    define the desired read length and P-site offset, and further measure the translation of 
    open reading frames (ORFs) by calculating translation efficiency and discover novel ORFs 
    by computing ORFscore. Altogether, RiboSeeker covers the essential data processing and 
    analysis steps for ribosome profiling experiments.
